# ComplexNumber #
The aim of this project is to practice the basic concepts of object oriented programming; especially operator overloading. This project takes the complex numbers defined in mathematics and tries to actualize it in C++ programming language.

The program offers a comprehensive set of functionalities for working with complex numbers. It is designed to be flexible, efficient, and user-friendly.

## What is in it? ##
This C++ program defines a ComplexNumber class that represents complex numbers. The class provides a range of functionalities for working with complex numbers, including:

### Constructor ###
- Create complex numbers with default or specified real and imaginary parts.

### Copy Constructor ###
- Create a new complex number as a copy of an existing one.

### Destructor ###
- Handle resource cleanup when a complex number object is destroyed.

### Accessors ###
- Retrieve the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
- Calculate the modulus (magnitude) of a complex number.

### Modifiers ###
- Set the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.

### Arithmetic Operations ###
- Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers.
- Support in-place arithmetic operations (e.g., +=, -=, *=, /=).

### Conjugate ### 
- Obtain the conjugate of a complex number.

### Comparison Operators ### 
- Compare complex numbers for equality, inequality, and order relationships.

### Increment and Decrement Operators ###
- Support both pre-increment/pre-decrement and post-increment/post-decrement operations.

### Utility Functions ###
- Check if a complex number is zero.
- Print the complex number to the standard output.
- Determine the size of the complex number in memory.

### Input and Output Operators ###
- Overload << and >> operators for convenient input and output.
